Semantic Equivalence Logic Tool</br>
This is my final project for my Computer Science course. It is a tool created for students taking the Logic and Logic Programming module at the University of Kent. The tool can be used to work through solutions to semantic equivalence problems and there are explanations of the semantic equivalence rules in the Rules section.

In the Exercises section, there is a list of problems which you can work through, you can select them and you will be taken to the tool with the formulae input.

The tool parses the formulae using a tree structure of parent and child nodes to apply the selected rule to the formula.
